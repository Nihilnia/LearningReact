//? 1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
//To use react we need to import into our project
//JSX syntax is defined in React

//? 2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
//[object Object], because it' s actually a JS object.

//? 3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```;
//It' s not a single element. For to render in react we need to make a single element.

//? 4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
//My english not good enough but declarative is basically if we need to do anything we need to do //from like the beginning.
//But with imperative way/s like react we can use our components anywhere we want√ß

//? 5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
//I dont know.
